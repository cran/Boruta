Changes in 3.0:
       - More importance adapters defined.
       - Fixed TentativeRoughFix() bug making this function always return
       the original Boruta object without any modification.
       - Built-in multiple-comparisons correction, which breaks
       compatibility with older version of Boruta.
       Use pValue=0.001 and mcAdj=FALSE to trigger the legacy behaviour.
       - Experimental, "forced" mode of Boruta dropped. It is equivalent
       to fixing light argument of Boruta function to TRUE, its
       previously default value.


Changes in 2.1:
       - Fixed attStats() bug making withTentative argument behave
       opposite to what it should do. (Thanks to Jitao David Zhang
       for spotting this)


Changes in 2.0:
        - Allowed to replace randomForest with other importance source.
        - Changes in output; "rand" attributes are now called
        "shadow" ones.
        - ZScoreHistory is now ImpHistory; some scripts and old Boruta
        objects may become incompatible.
        - Documentation updates.


Changes in 1.5:
        - Improved performance of dealing with huge inputs.
        - Removed redundant decisionHistory from output.


Changes in 1.4:
        - Fixed manual entry suggesting that Boruta can only work
        for classification problems. (Thanks to Allan Engelhardt
        for spotting this)
        - Fixed an error occurring when all attributes are claimed
        Rejected during one of the initial rounds. (Thanks to
        Allan Engelhardt for spotting this)


Changes in 1.3:
        - Fixes to the output. (Thanks to Achim Zeileis for
        suggesting them)


Changes in 1.2:
        - New plotting function plotZHistory.
        - Changes in manual.


Changes in 1.1:
        - Fixed a bug making get*Formula functions throw error
        when Boruta was run with formula provided as a variable.
        - Fixed minor documentation inconsistency.


Changes in 1.0:
        - First public release.
